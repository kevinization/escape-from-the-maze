# Escape From The Maze

The code is in the `main.py` file.

The page where I helped the robot escape from the maze is: https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html

I have also included 3 difficult exercises to solve, which are:
- problem_world.json
- problem_world2.json
- problem_world3.json

To test them you just have to import them on the page I mentioned earlier
